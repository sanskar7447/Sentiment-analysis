Future amendments which can be made in this project :
1. Instead of using count vectorizer for changing the texts into vector, we can use tf-idf vectorizer.
2. Feature engineering on Date column to extract the month and weekday out of it .
3. Try increasing or decreasing the number of features and see how the accuracy is affected.
4. Add features like Polarity and subjectivity using TextBlob
